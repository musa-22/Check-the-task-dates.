During my time at university, I created a simple website to track how many days were left to submit assignments. The website included the following functionality:
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing assignments
Daily updates, automatically recalculating the remaining days for each assignment
Even now, I still use it in my work from time to time. It's a handy tool for tracking deadlines and tasks, and Iâ€™m glad it continues to be useful long after I created it.
